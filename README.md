# Pascal-Particle-Swarm-Optimiser

A pascal particle swarm optimiser with python tools to rewrite it for various applications.

Contains 3 Parts:
Part 1 is an etensible simple structure for a Particle Swarm Optimiser written in Pascal.
Part 2 is a python script designed to create compile and run the pascal source from within python, allowing for the creation of fast optimisers at runtime, this will be useful for symbollic AI and any metaprograms which need to utilise both high-performance optimisers, as well as an interprette environment.
Part 3 which is still in development will be the central transpiler which converts a subset of python into pascal for use in extending the pascal.
